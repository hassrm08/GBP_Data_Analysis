The purpose of this project was to evaluate the correlation between different testing methods used to quantify paper strength.

Two main methods, S-test and Concora, were compared againast one another to determine which method is more reliable.

Tests on various paper grades were compared to determine if there was any correlative effects beween the testing methods.

Data was collected on various paper grades over a series of production runs. 

A full Gage R&R comparison was carried out with the Minitab statistical software. 

The results suggest that the S-test has a higher reliability based on the results of the Gage comparison.

In this case, it is recommended that Concora be phased out as the primary means of measuring machine direciton paper strength and the S-test should take its place.
